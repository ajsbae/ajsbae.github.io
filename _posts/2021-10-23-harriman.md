First time going out solo for a backpacking trip. Not much that I can remember from this trip to be honest. Looking at the pictures it looked lke a beautiful early fall day. I got to camp pretty early and found a cute spot behind a big rock. Shortly after a boy scott troop from Great Neck South rolled in with about 15 teenagers. I settled into my tent and went on Twitter. Then around 10PM a group of 40 asian people came thru and were scrambling to find a spot. I have no idea how they found one. Then a few hours later they were karaoke-ing. In the morning I was eating oatmeal and a kid that was camping with his dad came over and started talking to me. He was very sweet and was retelling the hike they did the day before and telling me facts about trees. My hike that morning was brisk but very enjoyable. Later that day I met up with Jen and Aidan and went to Dia Beacon.
