The day started cold and I quickly warmed up as the sun came out.

This was my first ever winter hike and although I was a bit nervous it was loads of fun.

All along the trail there were these ice crystals underneath the first layer of soil. The structure was incredibly fascinating

I ate my lunch by a creek that I was walking parallel to for the second half of the day. This was my first time using my cook kit in the field and there were no hiccups.
