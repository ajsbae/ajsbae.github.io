> Ways to teach what you learn:
>
> - Do talks. At work, at meetups, to your family, to your dog, to yourself on your own YouTube channel. I don’t care that you’re an introvert. So am I. So are 90% of developers (I don’t know the real number, it’s a lot). Do you think you can get away from public speaking about technology for the rest of your career? Do you think it will ever get easier? Do you think you will learn faster if you just keep to yourself all day? Do talks. Speaking forces you to have skin in the game. Any embarrassment that results is only temporary - in fact it will drive you to be better. Worried that your talk will suck? Don’t worry - it will! Everyone has some amount of bad talks in them. Better to get them out earlier (when it doesn’t matter) than later (when you don’t have a choice). I challenge you to do 10 bad talks in a row and not improve. Do talks.
> - Blog. Blogging is the ultimate form of permissionless learning - you can Learn in Public on your own terms, under your own domain. If you want to build a brand or domain expertise, focus your writing on a specific topic so that people will start to recognize your work and subscribe for updates.”

> Acting For the Job You Want
>
> - “Solid technical expertise, full command of fundamentals
> - Impact on your team’s work
> - Being able to work across other teams
> - Seeing the “Bigger Picture”
> - Communication, Communication, Communication
> - Mentoring others

<hr/>

> We are all junior in some way, senior in others. You’ll find that elements of these ideas permeate the Principles, Tactics, and Strategies throughout this book.

> 5.3.1 Code
>
> - Juniors collect solutions. Seniors collect patterns.
> - Juniors get code working. Seniors keep code working.
> - Juniors deliver features. Seniors deliver outcomes.
> - Juniors fix bugs after they create them. Seniors create tooling to preclude bugs.
> - Juniors write tests because it’s required. Seniors require writing good tests – because they’ve seen what happens when you don’t.
> - Juniors hate technical debt. Seniors have written code that became technical debt (and know when to let it be and when to migrate).
> - Juniors love to keep code DRY. Seniors Avoid Hasty Abstractions.
> - Juniors try to write the best code the first time. Seniors understand code is read, moved, copied and deleted far more than it is written.
> - Juniors know how to use their tools. Seniors know when not to use them.

> 5.3.2 Learning
>
> - Juniors make one-off side projects. Seniors use their side projects daily, often to make themselves more productive at their day job.”
>   “> - Juniors learn to find the right answers. Seniors learn to ask the right questions.
> - Juniors know what they need to know. Seniors know what they don’t need to know.
> - Juniors should absorb best practices from others. Seniors can derive best practices from first principles and personal pain.
> - Juniors get stuck without docs and tutorials. Seniors aren’t afraid to read specs and view source.
> - Juniors might have strongly held beliefs. Seniors have had to change strongly held beliefs.
> - Juniors question themselves when they fail. Seniors know they just need to give themselves more time and try again.
> - Juniors stay on top of news. Seniors keep track of trends (especially Megatrends – Chapter 29).
> - Juniors try to avoid mistakes. Seniors have made them all – and know how to recover.
> - Juniors laugh at software tropes. Seniors know there’s a grain of truth in all of them.

> 5.3.3 Behavior
>
> - Juniors seek The Best. Seniors love the Good Enough (Chapter 16).
> - Juniors should say “Yes” often. Seniors should say “No” more.
> - Juniors should try to do the jobs they are given. Seniors should redesign their jobs as needed.
>   “> - Juniors complain about Open Source. Seniors understand Open Source only works thanks to contributors, not complainers.
> - Juniors solve problems. Seniors identify problems before they become problems.
> - Juniors start from what others say. Seniors start from what they need.
> - Juniors know how to build. Seniors know when to buy.
> - Juniors compare developer experience. Seniors look for hidden costs in user experience and in abstraction leaks.
> - Juniors write as an afterthought. Seniors weigh writing as much as coding.
> - Juniors leave comments. Seniors provide context.

> 5.3.4 Team
>
> - Juniors work within their teams. Seniors know when and how to work across teams.
> - Juniors grow their own output. Seniors grow their team’s output.
> - Juniors pair to learn best practices. Seniors pair to share expertise and see things in a new light.
> - Juniors get roped in. Seniors get buy-in.
> - Juniors must earn trust. Seniors inspire trust.
> - Juniors seek out mentors. Seniors know how to learn from peers.
> - Juniors work on improving themselves. Seniors work on improving their team, being a force multiplier through teaching, mentorship, and leadership.”

> In fact, the strategic saying of No can be your single most valuable action. Having made similar mistakes before, you are able to anticipate potential problems. Contributing in this way is often even better than suggesting an immediate solution. Sometimes, this goes as far as redesigning your own job if you realize you are not working on the right thing. If as a Junior Dev your goal was to fit in, as a Senior you have the power to stand out when it matters.

> “I propose the Platinum Rule to be that contract: Treat others as THEY want to be treated.”

>“Seeking the best has several hidden costs.
> -  Happiness: You don’t always know that you’ve got the best. You make your decisions under imperfect information — what reviews say, what friends tell you, what the marketing says — and then you buy something. Seeking the best only to find you have ended up with the second best is a recipe for disappointment. You end up comparing long feature checklists looking for the most amount of green. Most of which you don’t need. Even picking something, anything, gives you anxiety because you fear missing out.
> - Cooperation: Looking for the best transforms your world into a zero-sum finite game rather than a positive-sum infinite game. It’s cancerous to your worldview.
> - Efficiency: It is also ridiculously inefficient. The corollary of the Pareto principle is that the last 20% of something is the most expensive - and that’s what you have to sweat if you must seek “the best” all the time. It’s fine to seek the best - just know that you’re going to incur a disproportionately high cost.
> - Agency: People game “best-seekers” all the time, by defining for you what “best” is. Who wants to be Mayor on Foursquare? Who can compete to[…]”
>“Good Enough” is, well, good enough. Learn to define that for yourself, and to be happy when you get it, and you will be more reliably happy, cooperative, productive, and independent than you ever were.”

>“It is always easier to be more precise than it is to be more accurate. One produces more confidence. The other produces more results. Choose wisely.”
