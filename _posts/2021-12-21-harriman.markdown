The day started cold and I quickly warmed up as the sun came out.

This was my first ever winter hike and although I was a bit nervous it was loads of fun.

All along the trail there were these ice crystals underneath the first layer of soil. The structure was incredibly fascinating

I ate my lunch by a creek that I was walking parallel to for the second half of the day. This was my first time using my cook kit in the field and there were no hiccups.

After my hike I had about an hour to kill so I spent it at the coffee shop by the Sloatsburg train station.
