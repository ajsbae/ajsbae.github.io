With an early start I made my way over to Richards house in Fort Lee where we all met up and took off for the yCatskills. This is the first time hiking the Catskills to memory. We arrived at the trailhead and hiked around the base of the mountain until we started to go up elevation and boy was it tough. The hills were steep, and filled with roots and rocks. The forest just looked incredibly old and overgrown there was definitely something mystical about it. The boys don't hike often but they did a great job getting through the hike and racing the incoming rain storm. We made it back to the car in one piece but we were tired.
