**Day 0**

After having arrived at Grant Teton National Park (GTNP) the previous evening the primary goal of today was to secure our permits for our campsites for the next three days. Ivan and I woke up at 5AM to a crisp mountain morning and made our way to the Jenny Lake Ranger station. We were the first party at the hut where we would eventually secure the three permits that we were looking for. As the hours passed until the rangers opened up the booking window at 8AM we chatted up some climbers looking to do the same. Coming from Boston, Canada and the local area climbers were looking to camp at Lower Saddle where they would eventually attempt to climb the Grand Teton Mountain. Our plan was to spend 4 days and hike 36.14 miles along the Teton Crest trail.

At 7:58 AM a rugged ranger with deep blue eyes gave the group a spiel about proper backcountry behavior. C. Hollard the ranger with the deep blue eyes was the one who helped us secure the permits that we were there for. From there the day was over in my book, all we had to was kill time until our departure the following day. We looked around the rich mountain town of Jackson Hole where we picked up some last minute supplies and made our way back to the Grand Teton Climbers Ranch where we were staying.

Back at camp we hung out around the communal eating and cooking table and struck up a conversation with Spencer Baker. Spencer was on a road trip with his wife and two kids and was spending a few days at the park. I snuck in that we needed a ride to the trailhead the next morning and Spencer kindly offered to drive us there if our schedules happened to align. We headed to bed with a sense of anticipation of what the next 4 days will be like.

Today was the day. After speaking about this trip for years, and planning it for the past 6 months Ivan and I were finally ready to hit the trail. We found Spencer at the dining tables at the Ranch and it turns out we were in luck. He followed our car to the String Lake Trailhead where we dropped off the car with the hope that we would return to it in 4 days time. We hopped into Spencer's car and we chatted about his youth as a climber working at National Parks around the country until we finally arrived at the Death Canyon Trailhead. After he drove off it finally hit me, the most ambitious outdoor adventure I have ever embarked on had just started.

As we started down the trail I was met with a gentle trail that was canopied by trees and plants that I have never seen before on the east coast. The sound of flowing water that we would hear for the majority of the trip was comforting knowing that water would not be an issue on this particular trip. The path eventually led to a series of switchbacks and on a bend with an overlook we caught our first breathtaking scene. Ivan and I peered over Lake Phelps and we both knew immediately that this hike/trip would not be like the ones that we were accustomed to. We continued to gain elevation as we snaked through giant granite mountains which seemed enormous at the time but would pale in comparison to the ones that we would see later on our trip.

We continued down the trail until we finally reached the floor of the valley where we were greeted with a vast openness that we hand't previously experienced on the trail. For the next few miles, we continued through the valley with a dense coniferous forest to our left and the steep green, granite crested slope to our right. We kept on an eye on the crest on our right knowing that our journey tomorrow would take us to the top of the crest into Alaska Basin. As we filtered through the campsites looking for the best option we eventually found the one that we would spend our first night. We set up camp and I filled my belly with a rice and bean burrito and fell asleep as the sun set that night.

I thought that I would wake up the next morning and our adventure would continue but at 11PM I heard a unidentified animal gnawing at the buckle of my bag that was sticking out of my tent. When I finally realized what was happening my heart started to beat at a rapid pace not knowing the size and the potential danger that I may be in. Once I was able to finally turn on the flashlight on my phone I was quick to identify the only animal that could have hundreds of quills coming out of it's back. I quickly made animal noises to scare away my intruder and bring all of my gear inside my tent. For the next 30 minutes the porcupine was still interested in my tent and circled it stoking my anxieties on what other creatures may be visiting my tent that night. Eventually I was able to fall asleep finally putting an end to my exciting first night on the trail.
