First time backpacking with friends and my friends first time backpacking. Went with Thu, Aidan and Jen and it was tough as hell. The hiking was slow and exhausting but it was a great time. The weather was hot and humid, we were lucky to be out on one of the last hot days of the year. While we were finishing up our hike moral was low and we were desperately looking for a suitable campsite to rest. We walked along Silver Mine Lake on good word that there would be camp sites available. As Aidan and I scurried along the shore looking for the aforementioned sites we were getting discouraged at what we were seeing. Until at the very north end of the lake we saw it. It was a small peninsula that served as our camp.
