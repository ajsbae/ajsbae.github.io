Drove up to Harriman on a warm Saturday and started my hike out of Lake Tiorati parking lot. The hike was leisurely and when I arrived at the Fingerboard Shelter I was surprised at how many great spots there were for camping. I had been curious about the Cave Shelter since my first trip along the AT and what I found was a great flat area under a huge rock. It might have been good on a different day but it was was too buggy this particular day. I set up camp facing the sunset and chomped on my trail mix while reading Let My People Go Surfing on my phone. The midges were flying all around me so I would hide in my tent for a bit. As I was gathering my firewood and cooking up some dinner I started to feel a bit of a scratch in my throat but thought nothing of it. As I first got into my bag at night I really started to feel it in my throat and my respiratory system. I was tossing and turning and could not catch my breath. One wrong turn and I felt my quilt buckle sink into my pad and it starting to deflate. In my delirious state I went over to my bag to get my tape and fixed up the pad. Luckily it was enough to patch up the hole until the next morning. It was an awful night of sleep but the sunrise the next morning almost made up for it.

The hike the next morning was a really slog. My muscles were achy and I could never catch my breath. I quickly ran to the car and made my home. As I reach downtown Manhattan the traffic came to a standstill. The NYC 5Boro bike tour was happening and it took me an additional 45 minutes to reach home and subsequently test positive for COVID.
