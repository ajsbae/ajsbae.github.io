We took the car to Reaves Meadow Parking Lot on a late winter day, as we were taking off a threatening storm was approaching. After a quick lunch break before setting off the rain started to come down. Luckily we were able to wait out the storm in the car. We walked through a muddy Harriman park with the smell of wet vegetation surrounding us. As we made our way to the campsite there were a few showers but by the time we made it to camp we were pretty dry. Our camp was a flat edge of a hill overlooking a meadow. As the night turned cold we made our way into our bags with hot nalgenes between our legs.As we made our way back to the car the next morning we took a shortcut that saved us a bit of time.
